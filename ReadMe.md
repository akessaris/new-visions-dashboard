# New Visions for Public Schools Challenge

## Challenge Description
Dashboards are displays we build at New Visions to help each other
and our schools make sense of school data. Create a principal and guidance-counselor facing
dashboard from the provided dataset that assists in identifying students who are chronically
absent (missing X% or more of school days) for targeted interventions by guidance counselors
(e.g. parent conferences, SMS messages sent, phone calls home, etc).

Specifically, build a dashboard that:
* Displays a list of students who are chronically absent, including the data points from the
data set you feel would be useful and relevant to view alongside each student.
* Allows the principal or guidance counselor to adjust the threshold for what it means to be
chronically absent. Upon modifying the threshold, the list of students should change.

## Technologies Used
* Node.js
* Handlebars
* Express
* MongoDB
